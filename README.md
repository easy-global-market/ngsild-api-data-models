# NGSI-LD API introduction and data models

## What this repository contains?

This repository contains:
- Specific JSON-LD contexts we are working on currently. They are expected to be integrated within the [Smart Data Models repository](https://github.com/smart-data-models/) once stable.
- A discussion on the use of [unit code](UnitCodes.md) in NGSI-LD payloads and transformation from senML units.
