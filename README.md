# NGSI-LD API introduction and data models

## What this repository contains?

This repository contains:
- Specific JSON-LD contexts and NGSI-LD sample payloads used in our current projects.
- A discussion on the use of [unit code](UnitCodes.md) in NGSI-LD payloads and transformation from senML units.

## Contribution guidelines
- New files and new directories names must be `camelCase`
- Intermediary directories such as `jsonld-contexts` and `ngsild-payloads` are `kebab-case`
- For compounds contexts files, use `camelCase` for the base name and apply `-compound` as a suffix (i.e: specialContext-compoun.jsonld)
